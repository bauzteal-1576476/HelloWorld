            Hi my name is Teal. I am in INFO 101 class section AB!! I am writing this paragraph as a part of my Cascade Styling Sheet Original Work assignment. Today was a very good day for me. It was chill, did not do much, except go to class. I can not wait to go home and sleep.

                Earth is estimated to be about 4.5 billion years old, and for much of that history it has been home to life in one weird form or another.
                Indeed, some scientists think life appeared the moment our planet's environment was stable enough to support it.
                The earliest evidence for life on Earth comes from fossilized mats of cyanobacteria called stromatolites in Greenland that are about 3.7 billion years old.
